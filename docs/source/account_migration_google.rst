================================================

Users who cannot use Australian Access Federation(AAF) because their organization
is not an AAF subscriber can use Google Authentication. This will need an
additional admin approval and will be restricted to specific use cases:

Before trying the new login method, you should log in with the Username / Password
form and verify that you can see your data:

The first time you log in with the Google account, you won't be able
to see your data. Your account will require administrator approval. At this stage Store.Monash administrator
have been notified about this and your account approval may take 1-2 business days.

Clicking on the Migrate My Account link will take you to a new Migrate My Account
page with a Username / Password form. Before you can make your data available to
your new login method, you need to verify that you can access your old account by
entering your Monash username and password:

After verifying your Monash username and password, you will see a Migrate button
allowing you to make your data available to your new account:

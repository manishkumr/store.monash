Store.Monash Account Migration to Australian Access Federation Account
======================================================================

There are now multiple ways to log in to Store.Monash. You can continue to log in
with your Monash username and password. However you are encouraged to try the
new Australian Access Federation login method:

Before trying the new login method, you should log in with the Username / Password
form and verify that you can see your data:

The first time you log in with the Australian Access Federation, you won't be able
to see your data, but you should see a Migrate My Account link which will allow
you to make all of your data accessible when using the new login method.

If you don't see the Migrate My Account link shown above, you can still access
the account migration feature as shown below:

Clicking on the Migrate My Account link will take you to a new Migrate My Account
page with a Username / Password form. Before you can make your data available to
your new login method, you need to verify that you can access your old account by
entering your Monash username and password:

After verifying your Monash username and password, you will see a Migrate button
allowing you to make your data available to your new account:

After your account has been migrated, you should see your old data available
when you log in using the new method:
